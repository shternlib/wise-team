  Build, run, and manage agent platforms.<br/>

## Introduction

Agno is an SDK for building agent platforms.

Build agents using any framework. Run them as production services with sessions, memory, tracing, scheduling, and RBAC. Manage everything from a single control plane.

Here's what you can build:
- [Coda →](https://docs.agno.com/tutorials/coda/overview) A code companion that lives in Slack and works alongside your team.
- [Dash →](https://docs.agno.com/tutorials/dash/overview) A self-learning data agent that grounds answers in 6 layers of context.
- [Scout →](https://docs.agno.com/tutorials/scout/overview) A context agent that navigates Slack and Google Drive to answer questions.
- [Auto Improving Agent Platform →](https://docs.agno.com/tutorials/starter/overview) The leanest agent platform with a built-in auto-improvement loop.

## Architecture

Agno has a 3-layer architecture. Everything except the control plane is free and open-source.

| Layer | Use it to |
|-------|--------------|
| **SDK** | Build agents, multi-agent teams, and agentic workflows. |
| **Runtime** | Run your agents, teams, and workflows as a service. |
| **Control Plane** | Manage your platform using the [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com). |

## Quickstart

Run a coding agent as a service.

### Built with the Agno SDK

Save this as `workbench.py`:

```python
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.os import AgentOS
from agno.tools.workspace import Workspace

workbench = Agent(
    name="Workbench",
    model="openai:gpt-5.4",
    tools=[Workspace(".",
        allowed=["read", "list", "search"],
        confirm=["write", "edit", "delete", "shell"],
    )],
    enable_agentic_memory=True,
    add_history_to_context=True,
    num_history_runs=3,
)

agent_os = AgentOS(
    agents=[workbench],
    tracing=True,
    db=SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db"),
)
app = agent_os.get_app()
```

`Workspace(".")` scopes the agent to the current directory. `read`, `list`, and `search` run freely. `write`, `edit`, `delete`, and `shell` require human approval.

<summary><strong>Built with the Claude Agent SDK</strong></summary>

```python
from agno.agents.claude import ClaudeAgent
from agno.db.sqlite import SqliteDb
from agno.os import AgentOS

agent = ClaudeAgent(
    name="Claude Agent",
    model="claude-opus-4-7",
    allowed_tools=["Read", "Bash"],
    permission_mode="acceptEdits",
)

agent_os = AgentOS(agents=[agent], db=SqliteDb(db_file="agno.db"), tracing=True)
app = agent_os.get_app()
```
</details>

### Run it

```bash
uv pip install -U 'agno[os]' openai

export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***

fastapi dev workbench.py
```

In 30 lines of code, you get:

- A FastAPI based agent server with 50+ endpoints
- Streaming responses, persistent sessions, per-user isolation
- Cron scheduling, human approval flows, and RBAC
- Native OpenTelemetry tracing

The API is available at `http://localhost:8000`. Checkout the OpenAPI spec at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Manage your platform using the AgentOS UI

The [AgentOS UI](https://os.agno.com) provides a control plane that connects directly to your running AgentOS. Test agents, inspect runs, view traces, manage sessions, and monitor system health.

1. Open [os.agno.com](https://os.agno.com) and sign in.
2. Click **"Connect OS"**.
3. Select **"Local"**.
4. Enter your endpoint URL (default: `http://localhost:8000`).
5. Name it "Local AgentOS" and click **"Connect"**.

Open Chat, select your agent, and ask:

> Tell me about the project

The agent reads your workspace and answers grounded in what it actually finds. Try a follow-up like "create a NOTES.md with three key takeaways." The run pauses for your approval before the file is written, since `write` is in the confirm list.

## Get started

- [Read the docs](https://docs.agno.com)
- [Build your first agent](https://docs.agno.com/first-agent)
- [Build an auto-improving agent platform](https://docs.agno.com/tutorials/starter/overview)

## Advantages of building an agent-platform with Agno

- [**Production API**](https://docs.agno.com/runtime/serve-as-api). 50+ endpoints with SSE and websockets to build a product on top of your agent platform.
- [**Storage**](https://docs.agno.com/runtime/storage). Store sessions, memory, knowledge, and traces in your own database. Postgres for sessions and memory. ClickHouse for OLAP data like traces.
- [**100+ integrations**](https://docs.agno.com/tools/toolkits/overview). Pre-built toolkits for 100+ tools.
- [**Context Providers**](https://docs.agno.com/runtime/context). Access live data from Slack, Drive, wikis, MCP, and custom sources.
- [**Human approval**](https://docs.agno.com/runtime/human-approval). Pause runs for user confirmation. Block tools that require admin approval.
- [**Observability**](https://docs.agno.com/runtime/observability). OpenTelemetry tracing, run history, and audit logs out of the box.
- [**Security**](https://docs.agno.com/runtime/security-and-auth). JWT-based RBAC and multi-user, multi-tenant isolation out of the box.
- [**Interfaces**](https://docs.agno.com/runtime/interfaces). Expose agents via Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, AG-UI, A2A.
- [**Scheduling**](https://docs.agno.com/runtime/scheduling). Cron-based scheduling and background jobs with no external infrastructure.
- [**Deploy anywhere**](https://docs.agno.com/runtime/deploy). Run on any cloud platform that runs containers. Docker, Railway, AWS, GCP.

## Use Agno with your coding agent

Two options:

1. **Add Agno docs as an indexed source.** In **Cursor:** Settings → Indexing & Docs → Add `https://docs.agno.com/llms-full.txt`. Also works in VSCode, Windsurf, and similar tools.
2. **Add Agno docs as an MCP server.** Add [docs.agno.com/mcp](https://docs.agno.com/mcp) to your favourite coding agent.
